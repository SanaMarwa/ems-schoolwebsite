          <br />
          <p>
            Our Toddler classroom is a nurturing environment where younger
            children have the freedom to safely explore and learn through
            discovery.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The space is organized, clean, and uncluttered with child-sized
            furniture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The atmosphere is positive, supportive, and non-competitive, which
            gives them an obvious joy in 'work' which builds self-confidence,
            concentration, and critical thinking skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The environment is language-rich, with adults using proper
            nomenclature rather than baby talk so that the children are exposed
            to and develop a broad vocabulary.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Based on daily observations, teachers introduce new materials and
            activities that develop curiosity and stimulate learning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>These Learning activities include:</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-care activities:</strong> Such as dressing up, using
              the toilet, washing one's hands, and making snacks all according
              to the child's personal capacity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Large motor skills:</strong> Like walking, balancing,
              running, climbing steps, and jumping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fine motor skills:</strong> Like grasping, reaching, using
              utensils, doing artwork, picking up objects, transferring objects,
              and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Caring for the environment:</strong> Food preparation,
              cleaning messes, taking care of plants and animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social skills:</strong> Interacting with peers, developing
              manners with adults, and teachers throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Language skills:</strong> Such as naming objects,
              discussing pictures, having conversations, singing, and more.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div id="primary-info">
          <h2 style="color: var(--color2);">Primary environment (3-6 years)</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Montessori primary program offers a unique, mixed-age classroom
            environment, for children approximately 3 to 6 years old.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our environment is a carefully prepared, purposeful, and aesthetic
            learning space for self-directed activities and an inner desire to
            learn. A child of three seeks to become independent. Often one hears
            the young child say, “Let me do it myself!” Children also want to
            imitate the adults around them. They need to practice the self-help
            skills that are necessary to help them grow into independent
            individuals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Teachers guide children by offering new challenges from which to
            choose in the classroom. Each area of the Montessori classroom has
            specific goals for children to learn.
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Practical Life activities</strong> fall into four main
                categories: care of self,
                care of the environment, control of movement,
                and grace and courtesy.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Daily activities such as sweeping, pouring, washing dishes,
                setting the table, and sewing builds self-confidence in the
                child's work and develop their concentration, order,
                coordination, and independence. Grace and courtesy lessons are
                designed to help the child feel comfortable with others and
                refine their social graces.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Sensorial</strong> area is unique to the Montessori
              environment. Each child learns from its sensory abilities through
              touch, smell, taste, texture, and sound. Sensorial materials have
              what is called "control of error", meaning that the child not only
              works with the material but has a way to check their work rather
              than seeking out the teacher if they have a question on whether or
              not they did it right. This is done to help promote independence
              and problem-solving on the part of the child.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Language area</strong> supports learning the shapes
              and sounds of letters, matching words and pictures, and composing
              words with the Moveable alphabet. They explore phonetic reading,
              phonograms, grammar material, and word study. Children are
              accessible to books all over the classroom and in the Reading
              Corner. The metal insets are an exercise used to refine pencil
              control and help to improve writing skills.
            </li>

            <li>
              In<strong> the Math area</strong> , children are introduced to
              mathematical concepts in order of concrete to abstract; starting
              with tactile impressions  of quantities and progressing to
              memorization. The child develops concepts, such as place value,
              numeration, fractions, and simple operations of addition,
              multiplication, subtraction, and division.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Culture area</strong> is divided into various groups,
              such as botany, zoology, geography, history, music, art, and
              general science. In geography, children are exposed to maps,
              flags, landforms, animals, language, etc. from all 7 continents
              which supports their understanding of the world around them.
            </li>

            <li>
              In <strong>Science area</strong>, children learn about botany like
              plants, trees, leaves, flowers, etc, and different classifications
              of animals like mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects,
              dinosaurs, etc. Children have interactive experiences as they
              perform hands-on science experiments.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Art</strong> exposes children to learning skills such as
              pasting, drawing, cutting, painting, and collaging. Each month we
              highlight a different artist and talk about their color choices or
              subjects and try to bring them to life through stories and shared
              experiences.
            </li>

            Summer learning need not be boring!!! As we provide fun and engaging
            activities for your child. While they are having fun and exploring
            their own interests, they are also increasing their own capacities
            for learning, teamwork, problem-solving, knowledge, and
            self-awareness. Our Summer camp lasts for four weeks and is eligible
            for 3 years to 12 years old.
