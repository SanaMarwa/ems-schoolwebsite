            Our Toddler classroom is a nurturing environment where younger
            children have the freedom to safely explore and learn through
            discovery.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The space is organized, clean, and uncluttered with child-sized
            furniture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The atmosphere is positive, supportive, and non-competitive, which
            gives them an obvious joy in 'work' which builds self-confidence,
            concentration, and critical thinking skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The environment is language-rich, with adults using proper
            nomenclature rather than baby talk so that the children are exposed
            to and develop a broad vocabulary.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Based on daily observations, teachers introduce new materials and
            activities that develop curiosity and stimulate learning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>These Learning activities include:</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-care activities:</strong> Such as dressing up, using
              the toilet, washing one's hands, and making snacks all according
              to the child's personal capacity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Large motor skills:</strong> Like walking, balancing,
              running, climbing steps, and jumping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fine motor skills:</strong> Like grasping, reaching, using
              utensils, doing artwork, picking up objects, transferring objects,
              and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Caring for the environment:</strong> Food preparation,
              cleaning up after work, taking care of plants and animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social skills:</strong> Interacting with peers, developing
              social behavior and language with other children, adults and
              teachers throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Language skills:</strong> Such as naming objects,
              discussing pictures, having conversations, singing, and more.
            </li>

            The Montessori primary program offers a unique, mixed-age classroom
            environment, for children approximately 3 to 6 years old.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our environment is a carefully prepared, purposeful, and aesthetic
            learning space for self-directed activities, allowing for an inner
            desire to learn. A child, three years of age, seeks to become
            independent. Often one hears the young child say, “Let me do it
            myself!” Children also want to imitate adults around them. They need
            to practice self-help skills that are necessary to develop into
            independent individuals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Teachers guide children by offering new challenges within work from
            time to time, ensuring the child's interest to learn is kept alive.
            Each area of the Montessori classroom has specific goals in
            supporting the child to become an integrated individual.
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Practical Life activities</strong> fall into four main
                categories: care of self, care of the environment, control of
                movement, and grace and courtesy.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                These include activities such as sweeping, pouring, washing
                dishes, setting the table, and sewing builds self-confidence in
                the child's work and develop their concentration, order,
                coordination, and independence. These are activities that the
                child usually sees happening around him in his day to day life.
                Grace and courtesy lessons are designed to help the children
                feel comfortable with others and refine their social graces.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Sensorial area</strong> is unique to the Montessori
              environment. Each child learns from its sensory abilities through
              touch, smell, taste, texture, and sound. Sensorial materials have
              what is called "control of error", meaning that the child not only
              works with the material but has a way to check their work rather
              than relying on the teacher to do it for him. This is done to help
              promote confidence, independence, accountability and
              problem-solving on the part of the child.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Language area</strong> supports learning the shapes
              and sounds of letters, matching words and pictures, and composing
              words with the Moveable alphabet. They explore phonetic reading,
              phonograms, grammar material, and word study. Children have access
              to books at all times in the environment. They also have a space
              called the reading corner, to sit by themselves or with others and
              read. Children also work at refining their pencil control to make
              writing effortless and joyful. This is aided by the metal insets.
            </li>

            <li>
              In<strong> the Math area</strong> , children are formally
              introduced to mathematical concepts in order of concrete to
              abstract; starting with tactile impressions of quantities and
              progressing to memorization. The child develops concepts, such as
              place value, numeration, fractions, and simple operations of
              addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Culture area</strong> is offered in ways that the
              child truly experiences it. He is acquainted with various groups,
              such as botany, zoology, geography, history, music, art, and
              general science. In geography, children are exposed to maps,
              flags, landforms, animals, language, etc. from all 7 continents
              which supports their understanding of the world around them.
            </li>

            <li>
              In <strong>Science area</strong>, children learn about botany like
              plants, trees, leaves, flowers, etc, and different classifications
              of animals like mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects,
              dinosaurs, etc. Children have interactive experiences as they
              perform hands-on science experiments.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Art</strong> exposes children to learning skills such as
              pasting, drawing, cutting, painting, and collage making. Every
              month we highlight a different artist and talk about their art in
              terms of their colour choices, the subjects they chose. This is
              offered to the child in the form of stories and life experiences
              so he can live it to understand it.

            self-awareness. Our Summer camp lasts for four weeks and is eligible
